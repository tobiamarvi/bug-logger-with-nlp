# Bug Logger with Natural Language Processing

A web-based bug tracking system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate test cases for logged bugs. This project uses Flask as the web framework and Gemini AI for generating test cases based on bug descriptions.

## Features
- Bug Logging: Users can log bugs by providing a bug name and description.
- Test Case Generation: Uses NLP to automatically generate detailed test cases based on the bug description. Amount of test cases can be changed.
- Bug Deletion: Each bug has a delete button to remove it from the logged bugs list.
- Dynamic UI: The list of logged bugs is dynamically updated as users log or delete bugs.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Backend programming language.
- Flask: Web framework for building the web application.
- Gemini AI: A generative AI model used to generate test cases from bug descriptions.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend for user interface and styling.

## NOTE: 
A google ai API key is required for the '.env' file
